So the Bullet has a neat feature where you can pre-program roasting instructions with "recipes." I thought I would try it out, knowing a few general guidelines. As you continue, the power level should gradually decrease, while the fan level increases. Thankfully though, it operates like the cruise-control on a car, as in you can resume manual control on demand. I say thankfully because my initial stab was completely off for a larger 700g batch. I had to roast manually almost immediately into the roast. That's okay though, as I was able to get to a roast I was much happier with. I've been struggling with letting my roasts go on too long, effectively "baking" the beans which can make for blander, flatter tasting coffee.

I was able to both shorten the roast time on this decaf as well as take the roast to the highest roast level I have yet. It finished just barely into what folks call a vienna, or a light french roast. The beans just start to sheen a little with the oils. I can definitely taste the improvement, as I'm writing this quite a bit later, I made this roast on the 30th. I pulled the beans right at 430Â°F this time, which definitely made the shed a little smokier than it usually gets, but it was all worth it.
