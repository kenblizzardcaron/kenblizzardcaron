It’s about time I relaunched this site. I'm still figuring out why, but I can at least assure you that finally updating this site does _not_ mean that I'm on the job hunt again. I just got the itch to give it an honest go. I'm not sure who the audience for this will be. Of course there will be technical digressions, but I don't want this to be a purely developer-oriented site. I'd like to talk about whatever I feel like really, but who wants to read that? I guess I'm writing for me. Jackie is always suggesting I should write habitually. 

I've had this site for awhile now and it’s honestly been largely neglected. I’ll be honest, I almost forgot I had a website there for a little bit. This site started the same way many web developer’s websites end up being born. It just makes sense for you to have a web presence, even if it is a glorified landing page to host your resume. I read the dated biography, and I immediately felt embarrassed by the tone of it. I still can’t place exactly what I didn’t like, maybe I sounded too cavalier. Maybe it was the simplistic SVG graphic animations I thought was a fine idea at the time. I’m not sure it aged well and I replaced it pretty quickly. This site is on GitHub though, if you want to dig through the history I won’t stop you.

I'm not sure how many times I've decided I was going to start a blog. I'm not much of a writer but I sometimes wax nostalgic for the web before it was taken over by social media. When everyone had a LiveJournal or a blog and you had to intentionally take interest in them. I like the idea of them, more than actually writing them. Moreso, I’ve been drawn to the idea of [static site generators](https://github.com/collections/static-site-generators) for some time. It gives me a good excuse and geek out on how exactly I want it set up. Jekyll was cool in that GitHub Pages had support for them baked in, but I wasn't really about Ruby. I discovered [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) as a really nice JavaScript alternative and used that for a bit. Finally I landed on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) like so many others have. This blog post is really about testing the waters of the experience of writing for fun again. There's no reason this couldn't be a post on Medium, other than liking having granular control over everything. That and being in my _natural state_ of working in terminals and IDEs. It just feels right, WYSIWYG editors be damned.

I wish Gatsby existed when I was freelancing. It really is kind of delightful working in it. A couple years ago I relaunched my dad's very dated website, [Wire Specialties](https://wirespecialties.com/) as my first Gatsby project. It is a very basic site still, with some product descriptions and information. The most complicated thing about it is a sample request form powered by [Formik](https://formik.org/). If you can believe it, the old version used Perl CGI. I'll probably spend some time refreshing it some more soon. If you're a developer you know that a lot can change in two years. For one thing, CSS-in-JS was not nearly as common as it is today.

Well, dear reader, if you've made it this far you've probably realized I started writing without a clear plan on what I wanted to write. I've wasted enough of your time. As payment, I offer you a picture of our dog, everyone likes those, right?

The question is now, will I stick with this thing? Will I look back at this in six months, see one pointless post sitting here, get embarrassed by it and delete it? I'm not sure. Time will tell.
