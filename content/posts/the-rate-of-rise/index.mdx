In my last post, I purposefully left one a very interesting statistic just to focus on getting a simple post out the door. That is the rate-of-rise (ROR). It's calculated by how many degrees (Â°F) the roast is increasing by over the last minute. I don't pretend to have mastered reading this as to what it should be at a certain point of the roast. What I do know is that good roasters pay close attention to this statistic, and that if I want to become a better roaster I should spend some time understanding it more. What better way than to graph it?

Below is a bit of messier data. I say messy because it is a good idea to keep your batch size consistent in order to be able to learn from previous roasts. It's easier to expect the beans to be at a certain stage based on how long they've been roasting at predetermined heat levels and fan speeds. This one is messy because I was close to my standard 500 grams but I ran out of that type of bean. I'd have to make up the difference with some decaf, which would just introduce all sorts of variation. Any data I'd collect from it wouldn't be super valuable. Anyway, this isn't rocket science and the coffee will still come out tasting just fine. Just because you can easily take detailed logs of any roast doesn't mean you have to be extremely serious about it. Anyway let's take a look.

To further complicate things, the Bullet actually measures the ROR with two different sensors. One with a standard probe, and the other is a high test Infrared Bean Temperature Sensor. We're focusing on the later purely because it's the one they show in the internal graphs. I'll hold off on actually trying to intrepret this for now, but expect a follow-up, some day!
