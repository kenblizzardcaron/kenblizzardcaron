I'm finally feeling like I've gotten a sustainable routine with this roasting blog. It might not be of much interest to anyone else but that's okay. I've finally did some minor code refactoring so that it's easier to generate graphs without duplicating a ton of code. In a standard React app that would be trivial, but with the way Gatsby relies on GraphQL to import the CSV data, it really wasn't as straightforward as I expected at all. I can't avoid having to declare a custom `<StaticQuery`> component for every graph, but that's okay.

Anyway, I finally got a big 20 pound shipment of decaf from my old standby source for green beans, [Sweet Maria's](https://www.sweetmarias.com/). I made a 600 gram batch the other day that took about 14 minutes all in all. I started it up at a higher power than last time and was able to cut down on the roast time a bit. It finished at about what I'll call City+. I have no love for decaf but my better half likes to keep her caffeine in check, so often our morning pot of coffee is half-caff. It makes proper cupping and reviews of particular beans just about impossible so I still make pourovers for things like that. However it serves well enough for morning cups.
