Howdy. I’m a dedicated Austin-based developer. I have over a decade of professional experience designing and engineering web apps, video games, and wearable apps. I graduated from Champlain College back in 2009 with a Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Game & Interactive Development. Currently I'm loving being a UX Developer and helping people get jobs at Indeed. When I’m not coding you can often find me camping with my wife and dog, discovering new vegan restaurants, gaming, roasting coffee, or training for a race.
